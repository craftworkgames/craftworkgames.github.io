## Welcome

Welcome to the documentation for `MonoGame.Extended`. Here you will find material to learn about game development with MonoGame and C# in general.

To the left (or bottom right menu on mobile/tablet) is the sidebar where you can quickly jump to the information that is of interest to you.

`MonoGame.Extended`, or just `Extended` for short, is a set of utilities in the form of [free and open-source (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) libraries that provide common solutions problems related to game development. It is not an engine. It is not a framework. For more information on what `Extended` *is* and *is not*, read the [principles](/docs/about/principles).
